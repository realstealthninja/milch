# Milch
I feel like the guis in linux are lacking, in that they are lacking that certain simplicity of creating windows applications.
I wish to correct this with this project. Which probably will stagnate in development. But hopes are high and the seas of possibilities
seem endless. I wish to create a library which is both easy to use and more readable than the existing libraries. I know its a tough ask but this is how
innovation is made sheer will power and determination, of which the later I lack.

## Goals
- learn about XLib and how the X11 ecosystem is formed and adapted
- try to make a functioning library
- learn how libraries work
- in the far future create some sort of programming language adapting milch (think flutter)
- actually complete a project for once
